Free for all of us, forever.

The IFCtoLBD converter transforms Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files in STEP format into Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples. These RDF triples adhere to the ontologies created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Linked Building Data Community Group (W3C LBD-CG: https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/).

### What is IFC?
IFC is a vendor-neutral data format created by buildingSMART.  It helps different software in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) work together by sharing detailed information about building parts and their connections. You can find sample models here: [buildingSMART/Sample-Test-Files](https://github.com/buildingSMART/Sample-Test-Files/tree/master/IFC%202x3). Tools like Solibri Anywhere, BIMcollab ZOOM, FZKViewer, Tekla BIMsight, or BIM Vision can be used to view the files.

### What is RDF?
RDF is a web standard by the W3C. It organizes data into triples (subject, predicate, object) to make it easy to share and reuse information across different applications and combine large datasets from various sources.
(see [Verborgh, The Semantic Web & Linked Data](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/WebFundamentals/semantic-web/))

Proceedings of the 6th Linked Data in Architecture and Construction Workshop:
[The IFC to Linked Building Data Converter - Current Status](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2159/04paper.pdf).

It is recommended to use OpenJDK 21 (it is the modt current  Long-Term Support version). Java 17 is supported. OpenJava can be downloaded from  (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download).
On a Windows system, download the MSI file that matches your processor type (usually x64 aka Intel), and run it to install Java.

## Precompiled binaries

Precompiled applications are available in the published release.
https://github.com/jyrkioraskari/IFCtoLBD/releases

* Desktop application: IFCtoLBD-Desktop 
Use Java 21 for compiling the converter and the desktop app.  For the OpenAPI interface, it is recommended to use Java 21.

These are runnable JAR files. If the Java installation is fine, the file can be run by clicking it. 
When converting large files, `run.bat` can be used. It is also faster since it allows the program to use more memory for the calculation.


Also, Windows 10/11 installations are available. The zip files contain script files to run the program neatly in the windows operating system. 

If the program does not start, try the following command at the command line: `java -jar IFCtoLBD-Desktop.jar`.

## Source Code Documentation 

[Javadoc](https://jyrkioraskari.github.io/IFCtoLBD/)


Java programming examples can be found
[here ](/IFCtoLBD/examples.md).

The desktop user interface was created using Java FXML, a scripting language defining the user interface in Java applications. You can download the editor from Gluon Scene Builder (see https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/). In the editor, import the org.openjfx:javafx-graphics and org.openjfx:javafx-controls libraries to get the editor working using the library manager.


## Compiling the code
The converter can be compiled using Maven and the Java JDK. Maven is a build automation tool for managing a project’s build. You can download Maven from Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.

First, make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable point to the JAVA JDK directory. JRE is not enough. Then run the following commands:

- In Eclipse, select first Maven Update project for all projects. 
```
cd IFCtoRDF
call mvn clean install
cd ..

cd IFCtoLBD_Geometry
call mvn clean install
cd ..

cd IFCtoLBD
call mvn clean install
cd ..

cd IFCtoLBD_Desktop
call mvn clean install
cd ..

cd IFCtoLBD_OpenAPI
call mvn clean install
call mvn enunciate:docs install
cd ..

```
When done as shown above by using the command line, copy the files in your app folder  <app>  (can be any) and run the conversion.
```
copy  IFCtoRDF/target/ifc-to-lbd-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar <app>
copy  IFCtoLBD_Geometry/target/ifc_to_lbd_geometry-*.jar <app>
copy  IFCtoLBD/ifc-to-lbd-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar <app>
copy  <your ifc> <app>
cd <app>
 
java -cp * org.linkedbuildingdata.ifc2lbd.IFCtoLBDConverter http://lbd.example.com/ <your ifc> output.ttl 2
 
```

-  Note: If you have problems compiling the sources, remove the module-info.java files (they expect to find the JAR files of the Maven-referred libraries of older Java versions). 

OLD instruction was:
```
cd IFCtoLBD_OpenAPI
call mvn clean install
set MAVEN_OPTS=--add-exports jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.api=ALL-UNNAMED --add-exports jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.util=ALL-UNNAMED
call mvn enunciate:docs install
cd ..
```

Then, the best way to create a runnable [Java 19] (https://jdk.java.net/19/) program is to 
1. Use an Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/) installation,
2. Open org.linkedbuildingdata.ifc2lbd.Main class on the Eclipse editor
3. Select from the menu /Run/Run
4. Select the /File/Export:Java/Runnabe Jar file/Next
5. Launch configuration: -Select the created Main runtime configuration-, Package resource libraries into generated JAR
6. Select destination file and Finish.

An example command line usage of the program is:

```
java -jar IFCtoLBD.jar Duplex_A_20110505.ifc http://uribase out.ttl
```

## IFCtoLBD Python Implementation

The example implementation can be found in the IFCtoLBD_Python  subfolder

Installation:
```
pip install JPype1
pip install rdflib
```

```
# !/usr/bin/env python3
import pprint

import jpype
from rdflib import Graph, Literal, RDF, URIRef
# Enable Java imports
import jpype.imports

# Pull in types
from jpype.types import *

jpype.startJVM(classpath=['jars/*'])

IFCtoLBDConverter = jpype.JClass("org.linkedbuildingdata.ifc2lbd.IFCtoLBDConverter")

# Convert the IFC file into LBD level 3 model
lbdconverter = IFCtoLBDConverter("https://example.domain.de/", 3)

model = lbdconverter.convert("Duplex_A_20110505.ifc");
statements = model.listStatements();

g = Graph()

# Copy triples to the Python rdflib library
# Apache Jena  operations:
# -------------------
while statements.hasNext():
    triple = statements.next()
    rdf_subject = URIRef(triple.getSubject().toString())
    rdf_predicate = URIRef(triple.getPredicate().toString())
    if triple.getObject().isLiteral():
        rdf_object = Literal(triple.getObject().toString())
    else:
        rdf_object = URIRef(triple.getObject().toString())
    g.add((rdf_subject, rdf_predicate, rdf_object))

# rdflib operations:
# -------------------
for stmt in g:
    pprint.pprint(stmt)
jpype.shutdownJVM()

```

## Blog
### September 20, 2024
I wrote a Python program to demonstrate how the interfaces can be used to infer which door to use to 
enter a space. 
![Screen](https://github.com/jyrkioraskari/IFCtoLBD/blob/master/IFCtoLBD_Python/door_interface.png)

The short example code can be found [here](/IFCtoLBD_Python/IFCtoLBD_SPARQL_Open3D_Interface.py).



### September 19, 2024
While it’s still in the preliminary stages and requires thorough testing, a source code for our bounding box-based interface generation is now available. 
The code quality is being tested, and we are gearing up for the next pre-compiled release soon. If you encounter any bugs, please let me know.

### March 14, 2024

Just in case you have a path problem in a MacBook when writing Python: 
-- It is recommended yo use absolute path names for the Java library files (macOS). You can use a text editor Search&Replace to fix there ysour configuration at the line of code:
jpype.startJVM(classpath = ['...<the JAR files in your configuration>']).

A short example code of relative names can be found [here](https://github.com/jyrkioraskari/IFCtoLBD/blob/master/IFCtoLBD_Python/IFCtoLBD_RDFLibTurtle.py).


### March 11, 2024
The Python examples were rewritten so that the import error in some JPype versions should not appear.
Also, instructions to copy the jars folder was added.

### February 21, 2024

### January 02, 2024
The recommendations was changed to encourage to use one of the last two performant Long-Term Support version of Java (17 or 21).
  
### November 13, 2023  
The new user Java 17 (and above) compatible OpenAPI is now in the source code. Earlier Java versions are not supported as the current Enuciate package
has that limitation. 

### June 21, 2023  
The new user interface is in the testing phase. This is not the final version yet. I still test how the filtering can be made smarter.

![Screen](https://github.com/jyrkioraskari/IFCtoLBD/blob/master/IFCtoLBD_Desktop_2023/src/main/resources/screen2.PNG) (updated 21st Feb, 2024).
### March 1, 2023  
Tested and update the Python interface.

### February 13, 2023  
The geometry tests are finished. The converter now exports OBJ formatted geometry for the building elements. The ifcZip format support is implemented but needs still some more testing.

### June 07, 2022  
Support for xsd:decimal.

### May 16, 2022  
Support for multi-character Unicode sequences.

### April 19, 2022  
Added unlinked elements and those that have no LBD type. It allows using the converter when there are no BOT elements connected to the 
interested in elements.

### March 18, 2022  "This application requires a Java Runtime Environment"
The Windows executable bundle for the Open JDK was fixed to contain the Java version.

### December 15, 2021  Log4J
Last Sunday the software was patched to contain Log4J version 2.15 and today version 2.16 was added. 
The OpenAPI installation was shortly tested under Apache Tomcat 9.0.54 and updated to the current IFCtoLBD 
release. The Docker image is also updated.

### December 9, 2021  Command line converter tool

Example usage: 
java -jar IFCtoLBD_Java_15.jar  http://lbd.example.com/ c:\IFC\Duplex_A_20110505.ifc c:\IFC\Duplex_A_20110505.ttl

### December 7, 2021,  The degree sign character

The Unicode notation of the degree sign character caused Jena to stop reading the raw ifcOWL output. This is fixed now.

### September 6, 2021,  Java 15
Java 8 is more than seven years old now, which means that not all libraries are supporting that old Java variant anymore.  To keep the software secure, it is preferred to deprecate the version of the code in the long run. Currently, a separate Java 8 branch is kept in case only Java 8 can be used. 

### April 6, 2021  Support for European languages
The program code was modified so that the default backslash notation for UTF-8 characters is removed. äÄöÖåÅßüÜáÁàÀâÂ should be human-readable.

### October 13, 2020,  Testing the software
The software was tested to function with https://jdk.java.net/15/

### October 5, 2020,  Testing the software

Testing the correctness of the created bounding boxes.

## Frequently asked questions

1. What does it mean when IFCtoLBD says “Java heap space”?

    - This error typically occurs when converting a large file. It indicates the program has run out of memory allocated for the Java heap. To resolve this, try starting the program using run.bat


2. Why does the program say: *"Error: Cannot determine which IFC version the model it is: [IFC2X2_FINAL]"*

   - IFC 2x2 Final was published as early as 2003, 14 years ago. There are still some test files that are generated using this version. Support for this may be added.  Currently, the supported IFC versions are  IFC2x3TC1, FC2x3FINAL, IFC4, IFC4 ADD1, and  IFC4 ADD2.

3. Nothing happens when I start the program.

   - Check that Java 15 is installed, open a command prompt, from the releases list, and download the precompiled
     binaries, then at the directory where IFCtoLBD-Desktop_Java_15.ja is located. Run the following command:
     `java -jar IFCtoLBD-Desktop_Java_15.jar`
	 
	- If any further problems, under the Windows 10 operating system, you can also try to use the 
	the bundled version of the converter: IFCtoLBD_Java15.exe  
	 
4. I have a problem running the OpenAPI interface under Apache Tomcat 9:
    - Check that the JAVA_HOME environmental variable at your computer points to Java version 15 or newer.
	The older versions of Java are not supported anymore (If you must use it for some reason, an older
	release of the converter can be used), since the used libraries don't support them anymore. 

5. In Windows, I cannot open the program by double-clicking the file
   - Open a command prompt as admin
   - Run the following commands:
   
   ```
   assoc .jar=jarfile
   type jarfile="your java installation directory\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%1" %*
   ```

   where *your java installation directory* is the base directory where your Java runtime is installed.

6.  How to disable the missing project natures in Eclipse prompt
   - open Eclipse.
   - go to Window > Preferences.
   - navigate to General > Project Natures.
    There, you can disable the option for discovering missing project natures and marketplace entries.     

7.  Eclipse build takes forever to complete
    - Disable Project/Build Automatically, and build the all with Maven Install. Enable the option after.
    - eclipse -clean -clearPersistedState  // It resets Eclipse perspectives, too.
